               Hello, my name is Gianpaolo Tabora! I was born and raised in Las Vegas and currently attend University of San Diego
                as a Computer Science student.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am interested in Game Development and love creating game projects that allow combining logic and self-expression. Academically,
                I am most intrigued by the developing field of artificial intelligence and how this would not only impact daily life, but the video game
                industry as well.
               </p>
               <p>
                To destress, I love to grab some snacks and watch movies or anime series.

              <h3>Sudoku Generator</h3>
              <p>
               My motivation for working on this project was gaining experience in object-oriented-programming and project design.
                Along with this, I think that my excitement for application creation helped in the learning process. Although the
                project seemed daunting because of the complexity and amount of effort it required, I knew that my interest in learning
                graphical user interfaces would increase my drive. I think that all these motivating factors are what helped my group and I
                give our full effort in the trial and error process of project design. Overall, I initially start this project thinking
                that my curiosity in application design would be satisfied, however, once completing it I believe that it has grown even more.
              </p>
              <p>
              The project generates a random Sudoku puzzle based on difficulty and allows that user to
                solve that puzzle for themselves. Feedback is given when the user checks the puzzle, which can help
                with finding mistakes, or determining the right answer.
              </p>
              <p>
              The project was programmed in Java and used a user interface (UI) called Java Swing. The design involved multiple
                object-oriented concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, test-driven-development and design patterns. Our design
                involved two interfaces, the BoardInterface and DashboardState interface. The BoardInterface provided methods that
                were implemented by the Board class, which then was inherited by its children, the rows, columns, blocks, and cells class.
                The GUI was created based on the State Design Pattern in which an object's internal state changes its behavior.
                The object changing the states of the UI is the Dashboard class. The DashboardState interface contains the methods implemented in
                each state class such as the MainMenuState, DifficultyState, and SudokuBoardState. The Dashboard manages these states and
                uses a function to change from one state to another, therefore changing the window that is displayed in the UI. Lastly, the Simulator
                class runs the whole program by providing functions to read in .csv files and to execute the initial UI window (Main Menu). Three of the
                four pillars were involved in this project. Inheritence was already mentioned, however polymorphism and encapsulation were also used.
                Polymorphism was used in the Cell class constructors. Two constructors were provided, in which one did not need a parameter, while the other
                required an int parameter. This allowed for flexible use of the cell class as it gave more uses for initialization. Lastly, encapsulation
                was used in most classes where UI classes and Board/subclasses of Board had private variables, encapsulating that data and making it only
                accessible through getter and setter methods. Abstraction was considered, however, there were not enough complex abstract methods in which
                using an abstract class would be more efficient. Test-driven-development was used throughout the entirety of this project, in which tests were
                created first, then the actual implementation of classes. This ensured that functions were always working properly, gave us insight
                into functionality improvements and also helped us in integrating these methods in an application.
              </p>
              <p>
              My contributions to this project involved creating tests, the UI system, and bug fixing. Initially, I created the column tests and half of the
                board tests. I then moved onto UI development which involved creating a State Design Pattern that changed the application window based on the user's
                button click input. It involved a Dashboard object that would render in the window and destroy the previous window.
                I created the UI designs for the sudoku board and I created the most of the UI functionality which involved the main menu buttons and sudoku board buttons. The main menu
                button just took the user to the difficulty screen. However the sudoku board buttons included the clear, main menu, and check button.
                The clear button cleared the entire board by setting the TextAreas to blank states, the Main Menu button returned the user to the main menu, and the check button
                returned a TextLabel that would given input on if the board was a correct solution, a valid state, or an invalid state, in which it would specify if the
                a block, column, row, or input was invalid. There were many bugs that arose throughout this project, I was responsible for fixing all of the UI bugs.
